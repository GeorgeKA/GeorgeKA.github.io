	As a certified Director on a Toronto condominium board, I meet regularly with my team to provide a quality living experience for the residents of over 200 units.<br/>
	Directors have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of unit owners. To that end, directors oversee and implement a variety of tasks.<br/><br/>
	At its most basic, the board must maintain the physical property, which includes soliciting quotes from vendors, assessing proposals, and collaborating with our regular contractors.<br/>
	Everyone involved from residents to condominium managers must comply with the Condominium Act, by-laws, and rules. Directors must make a reasonable effort to ensure this.<br/>
	Resident safety can't be overlooked. We work closely with the local police department to improve security.<br/>
	Unit owners must be kept up to date with annual meetings, and ad hoc communication.<br/>
	And of course there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's a prime responsibility to conduct all of the board's tasks while managing the operating budget and reserve fund.<br/>

	Environmental sustainability and self reliance have been interests of mine for some time now. To that end, I endeavour to optimize the small space available to me to grow those passions.<br/>
	In keeping with sustainability, I craft my own soil blend with compost from the city, sustainably sourced coconut coir (instead of unsustainably harvested perlite), and vermiculite. Also, I employ a version of hugelkultur in several of my raised beds to reduce soil requirements, and increase water retention. Mulching with straw also goes a long way when it comes to water retention, while doubling as an organic matter amendment.<br/><br/>
	I employ many other techniques like companion planting and drip irrigation to produce practical and bountiful harvests.<br/>

	Strong mind, strong body. I have found that athletics have enhanced my character and kept me disciplined, inside and outside the office.<br/>
	I have been bitten by the triathlon bug. After completing my first race season, I am eager to get back in the lake, on the saddle, and on the road.
