        From 2020 until mid 2024 I was a <font class="emphasis">software developer</font> on the Db2 development team. The specific team that I worked on was the Operating System Services team. This team handled the layer between Db2 and the operating system by providing operating system function wrappers for upper level Db2 components, handling memory management tools, and locking mechanisms.

	<tr><td colspan="3"><p class="content2">
        The role largely involved defect analysis, customer issue investigations, and new development projects. As <font class="emphasis">team lead and scrum master</font> I improved team cohesion and productivity by running weekly scrums, presenting skills sharing sessions to junior colleagues, and organizing our work items within GitHub & Zenhub.

The INGEST tool is a utility that simplifies the transport of data sets into tables without impact to running Db2 applications. While working on this and other projects in the past, I worked within an <font class="emphasis">agile framework</font>. We would start by identifying project requirements, providing sizing, (either with concrete dates, or via story points with PlanningPoker), and developing iteratively within sprints.

This role provided me the opportunity to engage head on with our customers.

		My final year project had my team working on a <font class="emphasis">GIS (geographic information system) for infection tracking within hospitals</font>, in partnership with RL Solutions. The final product was a success and brought us 2nd place in the faculty's competition.</br></br>
		The goal of this project was to provide hospitals with a tool to track the spread of hospital-acquired infections. We accomplished this with the use of RFID (radio frequency ID) readers and tags.</br></br>
		Essentially, all occupants and specialty equipment within a given hospital would be given small clothes-pin RFID tag wearables to wear during their stay within the building. Using the interactions of individuals, combined with our research of common hospital infections, (C. Diff and MRSA), we provided real time <font class="emphasis">infection probabilities</font> of occupants. And to boot, the system easily doubles as a hospital information system.
