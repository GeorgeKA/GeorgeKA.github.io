		In September 2010 I began my undergrad in <font class="emphasis">mechatronics engineering</font> at <font class="emphasis">McMaster University</font>.<br/>
		After 4 years and internship at Blackberry I successfully completed the program in April 2015.<br/><br/>
		What is mechatronics engineering? Simply put, it is the <i>design of computer controlled electromechanical systems</i>.

		Over my time in the industry I've managed to develop a breadth and depth of skills.<br/>

			Over the years I've developed a strong ability in <font class="emphasis">object oriented programming</font>.
			While working on defect analysis in complex code bases I've had to use that knowledge heavily while debugging. When basic log file analysis was insufficient, I've leaned on tools like <font class="emphasis">gdb</font> to step through core file stacks and piece together the origins of crashes. When convenient cores weren't available, I've gone deeper into <font class="emphasis">assembly language</font> to get a sense of the low level instructions and registers involved in particular stack frames. When commands have performed unexpectedly on the command line, I've used strace to investigate the multitude of OS calls involved. In summary, I've become a problem solver.</br></br>

			System administration, in particular <font class="emphasis">memory management</font> has been a recurring theme in my work. Though my work was on the development side, I've been involved in many customer situations where memory management was crucial, especially on systems that run particularly resource intensive applications that compete with each other. I have the know-how to investigate the breaking points of systems, then provide recommendations to get users back on their feet.</br></br>

			In my earlier years I <a href="projects.html#blackberryAnchor" class="lightDecoration">developed features for Blackberry 10 OS</a>, and robot control software using <a href="https://github.com/rtv/Stage" class="lightDecoration">Player Stage</a>.<br/><br/>
			To complement mechatronics engineering, I've got quite a bit of <font class="emphasis">C</font> experience from implementing various applications using microprocessors (ex. ARM), in conjunction with my object oriented work.<br/>
			Some of those applications include: a temperature sensing fan, stepper motor control, CAN communication, and a seven segment display.
